<div class="scene">

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>The hall of <span class="smcap">David Bliss’s</span> house is very comfortable
and extremely untidy. There are several of <span class="smcap">Simon’s</span>
cartoons scattered about the walls, masses of highly
coloured American and classical music strewn about the
piano, and lots of flowers and comfortable furniture. A
staircase ascends to a small balcony leading to the bedrooms,
<span class="smcap">David’s</span> study and <span class="smcap">Simon’s</span> room. There is a
door leading to the library down R. A service door above
it under the stairs. There are French windows at back,
and the front door on the L.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="direction">

<p>[<i>When the curtain rises it is about three o’clock on
a Saturday afternoon in June.</i></p>

<p>[<i><span class="smcap">Simon</span>, in an extremely dirty tennis shirt and
baggy grey flannel trousers, is crouched in the middle of
the floor, cutting out squares from cartridge paper.</i></p>

<p>[<i><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>, more neatly dressed, is stretched on the sofa,
reading a very violently bound volume of poems which
have been sent to her by an aspiring friend.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Listen to this, Simon. (<i>She reads.</i>) “Love’s
a Trollop stained with wine—Clawing at the breasts of
Adolescence—Nuzzling, tearing, shrieking, beating—God,
why were we fashioned so!” (<i>She laughs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: The poor girl’s potty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I wish she hadn’t sent me the beastly book. I
must say something nice about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: The binding’s very dashing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: She used to be such fun before she married that
gloomy little man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: She was always a fierce <i>poseuse</i>. It’s so silly of
people to try and cultivate the artistic temperament. <i>Au
fond</i> she’s just a normal, bouncing Englishwoman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: You didn’t shave this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I know I didn’t, but I’m going to in a minute,
when I’ve finished this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I sometimes wish we were more normal and
bouncing, Simon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I should like to be a fresh, open-air girl with
a passion for games.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Thank God you’re not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: It would be so soothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Not in this house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Where’s Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: In the garden, practising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Practising?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: She’s learning the names of the flowers by
heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: What’s she up to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I don’t know.—Damn! that’s crooked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I always distrust her when she becomes the
Squire’s lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: So do I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: She’s been at it hard all day—she tapped the
barometer this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: She’s probably got a plan about impressing
somebody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>taking a cigarette</i>): I wonder who.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Some dreary, infatuated young man will appear
soon, I expect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Not to-day? You don’t think she’s asked anyone
down to-day, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I don’t know. Has Father noticed anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: No; he’s too immersed in work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Perhaps Clara will know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Yell for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>calling</i>): Clara! Clara!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Oh, Simon, I <i>do</i> hope she hasn’t asked anyone
down to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Why? Have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>crossly</i>): Why on earth didn’t you tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I didn’t think you’d care one way or another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Who is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Richard Greatham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: How exciting! I’ve never heard of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I shouldn’t flaunt your ignorance if I were
you—it makes you look silly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>rising</i>): Well, that’s done. (<i>He rolls up the
cartridge paper.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Everybody’s heard of Richard Greatham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>amiably</i>): How lovely for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: He’s a frightfully well-known diplomatist—I
met him at the Mainwarings’ dance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: He’ll need all his diplomacy here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I warned him not to expect good manners,
but I hope you’ll be as pleasant to him as you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>gently</i>): I’ve never met any diplomatists, Sorel,
but as a class I’m extremely prejudiced against them.
They’re so suave and polished and debonair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: You could be a little more polished without
losing caste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Will he have the papers with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: What papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>vaguely</i>): Oh, any papers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I wish you’d confine your biting irony to your
caricatures, Simon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: And I wish you’d confine your girlish infatuations
to London, and not force them on your defenceless
family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I shall keep him out of your way as much as
possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Do, darling.</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Clara</span>. She is a hot, round, untidy little
woman.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Clara, has Mother asked anyone down this
week-end?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>: I don’t know, dear. There isn’t much food in
the house, and Amy’s got toothache.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I’ve got some oil of cloves somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>: She tried that, but it only burnt her tongue.
The poor girl’s been writhing about in the scullery like
one o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: You haven’t forgotten to put those flowers in
the Japanese room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: The Japanese room is essentially feminine, and
entirely unsuited to the Pet of the Foreign Office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Shut up, Simon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>: The room looks lovely, dear—you needn’t
worry. Just like your mother’s dressing-room on a first
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: How restful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Sorel</span></i>): Have you told her about your boy
friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>pained</i>): Not boy friend, Clara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>going round, picking up things</i>): Oh, well, whatever
he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I think Sorel’s beginning to be ashamed of us
all, Clara—I don’t altogether blame her; we are very
slapdash.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>: Are you going to leave that picture in the
guests’ bathroom, dear? I don’t know if it’s quite the thing—lots
of pink, naked women rolling about in a field.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>severely</i>): Nudity can be very beautiful, Clara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>: Oh, can it! Perhaps being a dresser for so long
’as spoilt me eye for it. (<i>She goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Clara’s looking tired. We ought to have more
servants and not depend on her so much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: You know we can never keep them. You’re
right about us being slapdash, Simon. I wish we weren’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Does it matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: It must, I think—to other people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: It’s not our fault—it’s the way we’ve been
brought up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Well, if we’re clever enough to realise that, we
ought to be clever enough to change ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I’m not sure that I want to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: We’re so awfully bad-mannered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Not to people we like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: The people we like put up with it because they
like us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: What do you mean, exactly, by bad manners?
Lack of social tricks and small-talk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: We never attempt to look after people when
they come here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Why should we? It’s loathsome being looked
after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Yes, but people like little attentions. We’ve
never once asked anyone if they’ve slept well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I consider that an impertinence, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I’m going to try to improve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: You’re only going on like this because you’ve
got a mania for a diplomatist. You’ll soon return to
normal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>earnestly</i>): Abnormal, Simon—that’s what we
are. Abnormal. People stare in astonishment when we
say what we consider perfectly ordinary things. I just
remarked at Freda’s lunch the other day how nice it
would be if someone invented something to make all our
faces go up like the Chinese, because I was so bored with
them going down—and they all thought I was mad!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: It’s no use worrying, darling; we see things
differently, I suppose, and if people don’t like it they must
lump it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Mother’s been awfully restless lately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Yes, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Life must be terribly dull for her now, with
nothing to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: She’ll go back soon, I expect; people never
retire from the stage for long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Father will be livid if she does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: That won’t matter.</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Judith</span> from the garden. She is carrying an
armful of flowers and wearing a tea-gown, a large
garden hat, gauntlet gloves and goloshes.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You look awfully dirty, Simon. What have
you been doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>nonchalantly</i>): Not washing very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You should, darling, really. It’s so bad for
your skin to leave things about on it. (<i>She proceeds to take
off her goloshes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Clara says Amy’s got toothache.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Poor dear! There’s some oil of cloves in my
medicine cupboard. Who is Amy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: The scullery-maid, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: How extraordinary! She doesn’t look Amy a
bit, does she? Much more Flossie.—Give me a cigarette.</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>[<i><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> gives her a cigarette and lights it.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Delphiniums are those stubby red flowers, aren’t they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: No, darling, they’re tall and blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Yes, of course. The red ones are somebody’s
name—Asters, that’s it. I knew it was something opulent.
I do hope Clara has remembered about the Japanese
room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Japanese room!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Yes; I told her to put some flowers in it and
take Simon’s flannels out of the wardrobe drawer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: So did I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>ominously</i>): Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>airily</i>): I’ve asked Richard Greatham down for
the week-end—I didn’t think you’d mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Mind! How dared you do such a thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: He’s a diplomatist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: That makes it much worse. We must wire
and put him off at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: It’s too late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Well, we’ll tell Clara to say we’ve been called
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: That would be extremely rude, and, anyhow,
I <i>want</i> to see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You mean to stand there in cold blood and
tell me you’ve asked a complete stranger down for the
week-end, and that you want to see him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I’ve often done it before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I fail to see how that helps matters. Where’s
he going to sleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: The Japanese room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Oh, no, he isn’t—Sandy Tyrell is sleeping
in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: There now! What did I tell you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Sandy—what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Tyrell, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Why didn’t you tell us, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I did. I’ve talked of nothing but Sandy Tyrell
for days. I adore Sandy Tyrell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: You’ve never mentioned him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Who is he, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: He’s a perfect darling, and madly in love with
me—at least, it isn’t me really, it’s my Celebrated Actress
glamour—but it gives me a divinely cosy feeling. I met
him at Nora Trent’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Mother, I wish you’d give up this sort of
thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: What exactly do you mean by “this sort of
thing,” Sorel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: You know perfectly well what I mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Are you attempting to criticise me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I should have thought you’d be above encouraging
silly callow young men who are infatuated by your
name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: That may be true, but I shall allow nobody
but myself to say it. I hoped you’d grow up a good
daughter to me, not a critical aunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: It’s so terribly cheap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Cheap! Nonsense! What about your diplomatist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Surely that’s a little different, dear?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: If you mean that because you happen to be a
vigorous <i>ingénue</i> of nineteen you have the complete
monopoly of any amorous adventure there may be about,
I feel it my firm duty to disillusion you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: But, Mother——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Anyone would think I was eighty, the way
you go on. It was a great mistake not sending you to
boarding schools, and you coming back and me being
your elder sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: It wouldn’t have been any use. Everyone
knows we’re your son and daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Only because I was stupid enough to dandle
you about in front of cameras when you were little. I
knew I should regret it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I don’t see any point in trying to be younger
than you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: At your age, dear, it would be indecent if you
did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: But, Mother darling, don’t you see, it’s awfully
undignified for you to go flaunting about with young
men?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I don’t flaunt about—I never have. I’ve been
morally an extremely nice woman all my life—more or
less—and if dabbling gives me pleasure, I don’t see why
I shouldn’t dabble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: But it oughtn’t to give you pleasure any
more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You know, Sorel, you grow more damnably
feminine every day. I wish I’d brought you up differently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I’m proud of being feminine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>kissing her</i>): You’re a darling, and I adore
you; and you’re very pretty, and I’m madly jealous of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>with her arms round her</i>): Are you really? How
lovely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You will be nice to Sandy, won’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>breaking away</i>): Can’t he sleep in “Little
Hell”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: My dear, he’s frightfully athletic, and all those
hot-water pipes will sap his vitality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: They’ll sap Richard’s vitality too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: He won’t notice them; he’s probably used to
scorching tropical Embassies with punkahs waving and
everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: He’s sure to be deadly, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: You’re getting far too blasé and exclusive,
Simon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Nothing of the sort. Only I loathe being hearty
with your men friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: You’ve never been even civil to any of my
friends, men or women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Don’t bicker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Anyhow, the Japanese room’s a woman’s room,
and a woman ought to have it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I promised it to Sandy—he loves anything
Japanese.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: So does Myra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Myra!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Myra Arundel. I’ve asked her down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You’ve—what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I’ve asked Myra down for the week-end—she’s
awfully amusing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Well, all I can say is, it’s beastly of you. You
might have warned me. What on earth will Richard say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Something exquisitely non-committal, I expect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: This is too much! Do you mean to tell me,
Simon——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>firmly</i>): Yes, Mother, I do. I’ve asked Myra
down, and I have a perfect right to. You’ve always
brought us up to be free about things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Myra Arundel is straining freedom to its
utmost limits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Don’t you like her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: No, dear, I detest her. She’s far too old for
you, and she goes about using Sex as a sort of shrimping
net.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Really, Mother——!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s no use being cross. You know perfectly
well I dislike her, and that’s why you never told me she
was coming until too late to stop her. It’s intolerable of
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>grandly</i>): Whether she’s here or not is a matter
of extreme indifference to me, but I’m afraid Richard
won’t like her very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: You’re afraid he’ll like her too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: That was an offensive remark, Simon, and
rather silly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>plaintively</i>): Why on earth don’t you fall in
love with nice young girls, instead of self-conscious
vampires?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: She’s not a vampire, and I never said I was in
love with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: He’s crazy about her. She butters him up and
admires his sketches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: What about you picking up old gentlemen at
dances?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>furiously</i>): He’s <i>not</i> old!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You’ve both upset me thoroughly. I wanted
a nice, restful week-end, with moments of Sandy’s ingenuous
affection to warm the cockles of my heart when
I felt in the mood, and now the house is going to be full
of discord—not enough food, everyone fighting for the
bath—perfect agony! I wish I were dead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: You needn’t worry about Myra and me. We
shall keep out of everyone’s way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I shall take Richard on the river all day to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: In what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: The punt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I absolutely forbid you to go near the punt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: It’s sure to rain, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: What your father will say I tremble to think.
He needs complete quiet to finish off “The Sinful
Woman.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I see no reason for there to be any noise, unless
Sandy What’s-his-name is given to shouting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: If you’re rude to Sandy I shall be extremely
angry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>: I put it down by the kitchen table as usual,
but she never came in for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: She’s probably mousing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>: Don’t you worry your head—Zoe won’t come

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: I don’t want to be disturbed. (<i>He takes his
tray and goes upstairs; then he turns.</i>) Listen, Simon.
There’s a perfectly sweet flapper coming down by the

She’s an abject fool, but a useful type, and I want to study

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>bursting into tears of rage</i>): It’s perfectly beastly!

I liked without being cluttered up and frustrated by

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Don’t be infuriating, Mother.</p>

of late. I have tried to shut my eyes to it, but in vain.
At my time of life one must face bitter facts!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: This is going to be the blackest Saturday till
Monday we’ve ever spent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>tenderly</i>): Sorel, you mustn’t cry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Don’t sympathise with me; it’s only temper.</p>

very kind to everyone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Now then, Mother, none of that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>aggrieved</i>): I don’t know what you mean,
Simon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: You were being beautiful and sad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: But I am beautiful and sad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: You’re not particularly beautiful, darling, and
you never were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>glancing at herself in the glass</i>): Never mind;
I made thousands think I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: And as for being sad——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Now, Simon, I will not be dictated to like
this. If I say I’m sad, I <i>am</i> sad. You don’t understand,
because you’re precocious and tiresome.... There
comes a time in all women’s lives——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Oh dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: What did you say, Sorel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>recovering</i>): I said, “Oh dear!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Well, please don’t say it again, because it
annoys me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: You’re such a lovely hypocrite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>casting up her eyes</i>): I’m sure I don’t know
what I’ve done to be cursed with such ungrateful children.
It’s very cruel at my time of life——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: There you go again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>inconsequently</i>): You’re getting far too tall,
Sorel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Sorry, Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Give me another of those disgusting cigarettes—I
don’t know where they came from.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>giving her one</i>): Here. (<i>He lights it for her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I’m going to forget entirely about all these
dreadful people arriving. My mind henceforward shall be
a blank on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: It’s all very fine, Mother, but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I made a great decision this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: What kind of decision?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s a secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Aren’t you going to tell us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Of course. I meant it was a secret from your
Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I’m going back to the stage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I knew it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I’m stagnating, you see. I won’t stagnate as
long as there’s breath left in my body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Do you think it’s wise? You retired so very
finally last year. What excuse will you give for returning
so soon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: My public, dear—letters from my public!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Have you had any?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: One or two. That’s what decided me, really—I
ought to have had hundreds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: We’ll write some lovely ones, and you can
publish them in the papers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: You will be dignified about it all, won’t you,
darling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I’m much more dignified on the stage than
in the country—it’s my <i>milieu</i>. I’ve tried terribly hard
to be “landed gentry,” but without any real success. I
long for excitement and glamour. Think of the thrill of a
first night; all those ardent playgoers willing one to succeed;
the critics all leaning forward with glowing faces,
receptive and exultant—emitting queer little inarticulate
noises as some witty line tickles their fancy. The satisfied
grunt of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the abandoned gurgle of the
<i>Sunday Times</i>, and the shrill, enthusiastic scream of the
<i>Daily Express</i>! I can distinguish them all——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Have you got a play?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I think I shall revive “Love’s Whirlwind.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>collapsing on to sofa</i>): Oh, Mother! (<i>She gurgles
with laughter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>weakly</i>): Father will be furious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I can’t help that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: It’s such a fearful play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s a marvellous part. You mustn’t say too
much against it, Sorel. I’m willing to laugh at it a little
myself, but, after all, it <i>was</i> one of my greatest successes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Oh, it’s appalling—but I love it. It makes me
laugh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: The public love it too, and it doesn’t make
them laugh—much. (<i>She recites</i>) “You are a fool, a
blind, pitiable fool. You think because you have bought
my body that you have bought my soul!” You must say
that’s dramatic.—“I’ve dreamed of love like this, but I
never realised, I never knew how beautiful it could be in
reality!” That line always brought a tear to my eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: The Second Act <i>is</i> the best, there’s no doubt
about that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: From the moment Victor comes in it’s
strong—tremendously strong.... Be Victor a minute,
Sorel——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Do you mean when he comes in at the end of
the act?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Yes, you know—“Is this a game?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>with feeling</i>): “Is this a game?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>with spirit</i>): “Yes—and a game that must be
played to the finish.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: “Zara, what does this mean?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: “So many illusions shattered—so many
dreams trodden in the dust!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I’m George now—“I don’t understand! You
and Victor—My God!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: “Sssh! Isn’t that little Pam crying?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>savagely</i>): “She’ll cry more, poor mite, when
she realises her mother is a——”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>shrieking</i>): “Don’t say it—don’t say it!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: “Spare her that.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: “I’ve given you all that makes life worth
living—my youth, my womanhood, and now my child.
Would you tear the very heart out of me? I tell you that
it’s infamous that men like you should be allowed to
pollute Society. You have ruined my life—I have nothing
left—nothing. God in heaven, where am I to turn for
help....”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>through clenched teeth</i>): “Is this true? Answer
me—is this true?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>wailing</i>): “Yes, yes!”</p>

It’s Fate—everything that happens is Fate. That’s always
a great comfort to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>: More like arrant selfishness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You mustn’t be pert, Clara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>: Pert I may be, but I ’ave got some thought
for others. Eight for dinner—Amy going home early.
It’s more nor less than an imposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I motored down; my car’s outside. Would you

daughter Sorel, and my son Simon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> (<i>shaking hands</i>): How-do-you-do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>coldly</i>): I’m extremely well, thank you, and I

on a clear day, they tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I meant I’ve been looking forward to seeing
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: How perfectly sweet of you. Would you like
a drink?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: No thanks. I’m in training.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>sitting on sofa and motioning him to sit beside

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I’m boxing again in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I must come to your first night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: You look simply splendid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I’m so glad. You know, you mustn’t mind
if Simon and Sorel insult you a little—they’ve been very
bad-tempered lately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: It’s awfully funny you having a grown-up son
and daughter at all. I can hardly believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>quickly</i>): I was married very young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I don’t wonder. You know, it’s frightfully
queer the way I’ve been planning to know you for ages,
and I never did until last week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I liked you from the first, really, because
you’re such a nice shape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> (<i>slightly embarrassed</i>): Oh, I see....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Small hips and lovely long legs—I wish Simon
had smaller hips. Do you think you could teach him to
box?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Rather—if he likes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: That’s just the trouble—I’m afraid he won’t
like. He’s so dreadfully un——that sort of thing. But
never mind; you must use your influence subtly. I’m
sure David would be pleased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Who’s David?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: My husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> (<i>surprised</i>): Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Why do you say “Oh” like that? Didn’t you
know I had a husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I thought he was dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: No, he’s not dead; he’s upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: You’re quite different from what you were
the other day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s this garden hat—I’ll take it off. (<i>She does
so.</i>) There. I’ve been pruning the calceolarias.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> (<i>puzzled</i>): Oh?——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I love my garden, you know—it’s so peaceful
and quaint. I spend long days dreaming away in it—you
know how one dreams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>warming up</i>): I always longed to leave the
brittle glamour of cities and theatres and find rest in some
old-world nook. That’s why we came to Cookham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: It’s awfully nice—Cookham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Have you ever seen me on the stage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Rather!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: What in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: That thing when you pretended to cheat at
cards to save your husband’s good name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Oh, “The Bold Deceiver.” That play was
never quite right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: You were absolutely wonderful. That was
when I first fell in love with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>delighted</i>): Was it, really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Yes; you were so frightfully pathetic and
brave.</p>

me someone was motoring down. A nice car would have

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I never knew you were coming until a little
while ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: It’s heavenly here—after London. The heat
was terrible when I left. You look awfully well, Judith.
Rusticating obviously agrees with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: You look beautifully cool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: I’m more than cool really, but it’s not climatic
coolness. I’ve been mentally chilled to the marrow
by Judith’s attitude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Why, what did she say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: I dined with Charlie Templeton last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Well, you’re a devil. You only did it to annoy
me. He’s far too plump, and he can’t do anything but
dither about the Embassy in badly-cut trousers. You
loathe him really; you know you do—you’re too intelligent
not to. You couldn’t like him and me at the same
time—it’s impossible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: That’s right.</p>

You don’t care a damn. You don’t love me a bit, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: It isn’t—it’s tiny. What are we to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: No, we won’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Don’t let either of us agree to anything we

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Perhaps that funny woman who opened the
door will tell him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: It was fortunate that we met at the station.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I’m frightfully glad. I should have been
terrified arriving all by myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I do hope the weather will keep good over
Sunday—the country round here is delightful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: There’s nowhere like England in the spring
and summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: No, there isn’t, is there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: There’s a sort of <i>quality</i> you find in no other
countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Have you travelled a lot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>modestly</i>): A good deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: How lovely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Spain is very beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Yes, I’ve always heard Spain was awfully nice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Except for the bull-fights. No one who ever
really loved horses could enjoy a bull-fight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Nor anyone who loved bulls either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Exactly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Italy’s awfully nice, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Oh, yes, charming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I’ve always wanted to go to Italy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Rome is a beautiful city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Yes, I’ve always heard Rome was lovely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: And Naples and Capri—Capri’s enchanting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: It must be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Have you ever been abroad at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Oh, yes; I went to Dieppe once—we had a
house there for the summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>kindly</i>): Dear little place—Dieppe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Yes, it was lovely.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Russia used to be a wonderful country before
the war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: It must have been.... Was that her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Judith Bliss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Yes, I expect it was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I wish I’d never come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: You mustn’t worry. They’re a very
Bohemian family, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Yes, perhaps we’d better. (<i>He finds bell and

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I don’t suppose it rings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: You mustn’t be depressed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I feel horrid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: It’s always a little embarrassing coming to
a strange house for the first time. You’ll like Sorel—she’s
charming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span> (<i>desperately</i>): I wonder where she is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>consolingly</i>): I expect tea will be here soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Do you think they <i>have</i> tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>alarmed</i>): Oh, yes—they must.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Oh, well, we’d better go on waiting, then.
(<i>She sits down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Do you mind if I smoke?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Not a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: No, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>sitting down</i>): I got this case in Japan. It’s

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Oh, Richard, I’m dreadfully sorry. I didn’t
know you were here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: We’ve been here a good while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: How awful! Please forgive me. I was upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: This is Miss Coryton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: How-do-you-do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Have you come to see Father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: He’s in his study—you’d better go up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I don’t know the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>irritably</i>): Oh, well—I’ll take you. Come on.
Wait a minute, Richard. (<i>She takes her to the top of the
stairs.</i>) It’s along that passage, and the third door on the
right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Oh, thank you. (<i>She goes out despondently.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>coming down again</i>): The poor girl looks half-witted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: She’s shy, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I hope Father will find her a comfort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Tell me one thing, Sorel, did your Father
and Mother know I was coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Oh, yes; they were awfully pleased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: A rather nice-looking woman came down,
in a big hat, and went into the garden with a young man,
without saying a word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: That was Mother, I expect. We’re an independent
family—we entertain our friends sort of
separately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Oh, I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: It was sweet of you to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I wanted to come—I’ve thought about you
a lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Have you really? That’s thrilling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I mean it. You’re so alive and vital and
different from other people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I’m so frightened that you’ll be bored here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Why should I be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Oh, I don’t know. But you won’t be, will you?—or
if you are, tell me at once, and we’ll do something
quite different.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: You’re rather a dear, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I’m not—I’m devastating, entirely lacking in
restraint. So’s Simon. It’s Father’s and Mother’s fault
really; you see, they’re so vague—they’ve spent their lives
cultivating their Arts and not devoting any time to
ordinary conventions and manners and things. I’m the
only one who sees that, so I’m trying to be better. I’d
love to be beautifully poised and carry off difficult situations
with a lift of the eyebrows——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I’m sure you could carry off anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: There you are, you see, saying the right thing!
You always say the right thing, and no one knows a bit
what you’re really thinking. That’s what I adore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I’m afraid to say anything now, in case you
think I’m only being correct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: But you are correct. I wish you’d teach Simon
to be correct too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: It would be uphill work, I’m afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Why, don’t you like him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I’ve only met him for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Would you like to see the garden?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Very much indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: As a matter of fact, we’d better wait until after
tea. Shall I sing you something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Please—I should love it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I don’t want to really a bit—only I’m trying to
entertain you. It’s as easy as pie to talk in someone else’s
house, like at the dance the other night, but here on my
own ground I’m finding it difficult.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>puzzled</i>): I’m sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Oh, it isn’t your fault; honestly, it isn’t—you’re
awfully kind and responsive. What shall we do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I’m quite happy talking—to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Can you play Mah Jong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: No, I’m afraid I can’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Someone goes out, you see, and comes in, and
you’ve chosen a word among yourselves, and she or he
or whoever it is asks you some sort of question and you
have to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Not an ordinary question, Simon; they have to
ask them to do something in the manner of the word, and
then——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Then, you see, you act whatever it is——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: The answer to the question, you see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>apprehensively</i>): What sort of thing is one
expected to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Quite usual things, like reciting “If,” or
playing the piano——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I can’t play the piano.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Never mind; you can fake it, as long as it
conveys an idea of the word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: The word we’ve all thought of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>impatient</i>): Yes, the word we’ve chosen when
whoever it is is out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I’m afraid I don’t quite understand yet.</p>

goes out....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I’ll go out the first time, just to show her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s quite simple—all you have to do is just
act in the manner of the word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Look here, everybody, I’m going out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: All right; go on.</p>

at the Harringtons’ house. Everyone was blindfolded

about “winsomely”?</p>

when we played it at the Mackenzies’?</p>

Freddie’s ear in the manner of the word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: What was the word?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I can’t remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: Perhaps it’s as well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: What about “drearily”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Not definite enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: “Winsomely” is the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: She’s sure to guess it straight off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>confidentially to <span class="smcap">Jackie</span></i>): These games are much
too brainy for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Young Norman Robertson used to be marvellous—do
you remember?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Yes, wonderful sense of humour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: He’s lost it all since his marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I didn’t know you knew him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: Well, considering he married my cousin——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: We don’t seem to be getting on with the
game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: We haven’t thought of a word yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: “Brightly.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Too obvious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: Very well—don’t snap at me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: “Saucily.” I’ve got a lovely idea for “saucily.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span> (<i>at <span class="smcap">Simon</span></i>): I should think “rudely” would be
the easiest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Don’t be sour, Myra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: The great thing is to get an obscure word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: What a pity Irene isn’t here—she knows
masses of obscure words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: She’s probably picked them up from her
obscure friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: It’s no use being catty about Irene; she’s a
perfect darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: I wasn’t being catty at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Yes, you were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>off</i>): Hurry up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Quickly, now! We must think——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span> (<i>helpfully</i>): “Appendicitis.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>witheringly</i>): That’s not an adverb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: You’re thinking of Charades.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Charades are damned good fun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Yes, but we don’t happen to be doing them at
the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: “Saucily.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: No, “winsomely’s” better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: All right. Call her in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>calling</i>): Sorel—come on; we’re ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>whispering</i>): “Winsomely.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Judith</span></i>): Go and take a flower out of that
vase and give it to Richard.</p>

<p>[<i>She trips lightly over to the vase, gurgling with coy

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Marvellous, Mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>laughing</i>): Oh, lovely!... Now, Myra, get
up and say good-bye to everyone in the manner of the
word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span> (<i>rises and starts with <span class="smcap">David</span></i>): Good-bye. It
really has been most delightful——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: No, no, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: Why—what do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You haven’t got the right intonation a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Oh, Mother darling, do shut up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span> (<i>acidly</i>): Remember what an advantage you have
over we poor amateurs, Judith, having been a professional
for so long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I don’t like “so long” very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Do you think we might go on now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: Go to the next one; I’m not going to do any
more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Oh, please do. You were simply splendid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: It doesn’t matter. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Richard</span></i>) Light a
cigarette in the manner of the word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I’ve forgotten what it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: I can’t think <i>what</i> that’s meant to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>offended</i>): I was doing my best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s so <i>frightfully</i> easy, and nobody can do it
right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I believe you’ve muddled it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: You’d better go on to the next one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Which word were you doing? Whisper——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>whispering</i>): “Saucily.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I knew it!—He was doing the wrong word.
(<i>She whispers to him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Oh, I see. I’m so sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Give him another chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: No, it’s Jackie’s turn now; it will come round
to him again, I’m afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Jackie</span></i>): Do a dance in the manner of the
word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span> (<i>giggling</i>): I can’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Nonsense! Of course you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I can’t—honestly—I....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: No, I’d much rather not. Count me out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Really, the ridiculous fuss everyone makes——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I’m awfully stupid at anything like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: It’s only a game, after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Come along—try.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span> (<i>dragging back</i>): I couldn’t—please don’t ask
me to. I simply couldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Leave her alone if she doesn’t want to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>irritably</i>): What’s the use of playing at all, if
people won’t do it properly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s <i>so</i> simple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: It’s awfully difficult if you haven’t done it
before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Go on to the next one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>firmly</i>): Unless everyone’s in it we won’t play
at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Now don’t lose your temper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Lose my temper! I like that! No one’s given
me the slightest indication of what the word is—you all
argue and squabble——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Talk, talk, talk! Everybody talks too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s so surprising to me when people won’t
play up. After all——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span> (<i>with spirit</i>): It’s a hateful game, anyhow, and
I don’t want to play it again ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: You haven’t played it at all yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Don’t be rude, Sorel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Really, Simon, the way you go on is infuriating!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: It’s always the way; whenever Sorel goes out
she gets quarrelsome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Quarrelsome!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Don’t worry, Jackie; you needn’t do anything
you don’t want to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I think, for the future, we’d better confine
our efforts to social conversation and not attempt anything
in the least intelligent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: How can you be so unkind, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>sharply</i>): Don’t speak to me like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: It’s all my fault—I know I’m awfully silly,
but it embarrasses me so terribly doing anything in front
of people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>with acidity</i>): I should think the word was,
“winsomely.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: You must have been listening outside the door
then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Not at all—Miss Coryton gave it away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Why “Miss Coryton” all of a sudden?
You’ve been calling her Jackie all the evening. You’re
far too grand, Sorel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: And you’re absolutely maddening—I’ll never
play another game with you as long as I live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: That won’t break my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Stop, stop, stop!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>grabbing <span class="smcap">Jackie’s</span> hand</i>): Come out in the
garden. I’m sick of this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Don’t let him take you on the river; he isn’t
very good at it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>over his shoulder</i>): Ha, ha!—very funny. (<i>He
drags <span class="smcap">Jackie</span> off.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Sorel, you’re behaving disgracefully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Simon ought to go into the Army, or something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: You both ought to be in Reformatories.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: This always happens whenever we play a game.
We’re a beastly family, and I hate us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Speak for yourself, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I can’t, without speaking for everyone else too—we’re
all exactly the same, and I’m ashamed of us.—Come
into the library, Sandy. (<i>She drags <span class="smcap">Sandy</span> off.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: Charming! It’s all perfectly charming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: I think it would be better, Judith, if you
exercised a little more influence over the children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: That’s right—blame it all on me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: After all, dear, you started it, by snapping
everybody up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You ought never to have married me, David;
it was a great mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: The atmosphere of this house is becoming
more unbearable every day, and all because Simon and
Sorel are allowed to do exactly what they like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You sit upstairs all day, writing your novels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Novels which earn us our daily bread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: “Daily bread” nonsense! We’ve got enough
money to keep us in comfort until we die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: That will be very soon, if we can’t get a little
peace. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Myra</span></i>) Come out into the garden——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I sincerely hope the night air will cool you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: I don’t know what’s happened to you lately,
Judith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Nothing’s happened to me—nothing ever
does. You’re far too smug to allow it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Smug! Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Yes, smug, smug, smug! And pompous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: I hope you haven’t been drinking, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Drinking! Huh! that’s very amusing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: I think it’s rather tragic, at your time of life.
(<i>He goes out with <span class="smcap">Myra</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: David’s been a good husband to me, but he’s
wearing a bit thin now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Would you like me to go? To leave you
alone for a little?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Why? Are you afraid I shall become violent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>smiling</i>): No; I merely thought perhaps I
was in the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I hope you’re not embarrassed—I couldn’t
bear you to be embarrassed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Not in the least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Marriage is a hideous affair altogether, don’t
you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I’m really hardly qualified to judge, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Do stop being non-committal, just for once;
it’s doubly annoying in the face of us all having lost
control so lamentably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I’m sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: There’s nothing to be sorry for, really,
because, after all, it’s your particular “thing,” isn’t it?—observing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
everything and not giving yourself away an
inch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I suppose it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You’ll get used to us in time, you know, and
then you’ll feel cosier. Why don’t you sit down? (<i>She sits
on sofa.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I’m enjoying myself very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s very sweet of you to say so, but I don’t
see how you can be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>laughing suddenly</i>): But I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: There now! that was quite a genuine laugh.
We’re getting on. Are you in love with Sorel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>surprised and embarrassed</i>): In love with
Sorel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>repentantly</i>): Now I’ve killed it—I’ve murdered
the little tender feeling of comfort that was stealing
over you, by sheer tactlessness! Will you teach me to be
tactful?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Did you really think I was in love with
Sorel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s so difficult to tell, isn’t it?—I mean, you
might not know yourself. She’s very attractive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Yes, she is—very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Have you heard her sing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: No, not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: She sings beautifully. Are you susceptible to
music?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I’m afraid I don’t know very much
about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You probably are, then. I’ll sing you something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Please do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>rising</i>): It’s awfully sad for a woman of my
temperament to have a grown-up daughter, you know.
I have to put my pride in my pocket and develop in her
all the charming little feminine tricks which will eventually
cut me out altogether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: That wouldn’t be possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I do hope you meant that, because it was
a sweet remark. (<i>She is at the piano, turning over music.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>following her</i>): Of course I meant it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Will you lean on the piano in an attentive
attitude? It’s such a help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: You’re an extraordinary person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>beginning to play</i>): In what way extraordinary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: When I first met Sorel, I guessed what you’d
be like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Did you, now? And am I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>smiling</i>): Exactly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Oh, well.... (<i>She plays and sings a little
French song.</i>)</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>[<i>There is a slight pause when it is finished.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>with feeling</i>): Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>rising from the piano</i>): It’s pretty, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Perfectly enchanting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Shall we sit down again? (<i>She re-seats herself
on sofa.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Won’t you sing any more?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: No, no more—I want you to talk to me and
tell me all about yourself, and the things you’ve done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I’ve done nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: What a shame! Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I never realise how dead I am until I meet
people like you. It’s depressing, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: What nonsense! You’re not a bit dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Do you always live here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I’m going to, from now onwards. I intend to
sink into a very beautiful old age. When the children
marry, I shall wear a cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>smiling</i>): How absurd!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I don’t mean a funny cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: You’re far too full of vitality to sink into
anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s entirely spurious vitality. If you troubled
to look below the surface, you’d find a very wistful and
weary spirit. I’ve been battling with life for a long time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Surely such successful battles as yours have
been are not wearying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Yes, they are—frightfully. I’ve reached an
age now when I just want to sit back and let things go
on around me—and they do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I should like to know exactly what you’re
thinking about—really.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I was thinking of calling you Richard. It’s
such a nice uncompromising name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I should be very flattered if you would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I won’t suggest you calling me Judith until
you feel really comfortable about me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: But I do—Judith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I’m awfully glad. Will you give me a cigarette?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>producing case</i>): Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>taking one</i>): That’s a divine case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: It was given to me in Japan three years ago.
All those little designs mean things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>bending over it</i>): What sort of things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Charms for happiness, and luck, and—love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Which is the charm for love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: That one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: What a dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>kissing her gently</i>): Judith!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>jumping</i>): Richard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I’m afraid I couldn’t help it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>dramatically</i>): What are we to do? What are
we to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: David must be told—everything!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>alarmed</i>): Everything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>enjoying herself</i>): Yes, yes. There come
moments in life when it is necessary to be honest—absolutely
honest. I’ve trained myself always to shun the
underhand methods other women so often employ—the
truth must be faced fair and square——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>extremely alarmed</i>): The truth? I don’t
quite understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Dear Richard, you want to spare me, I
know—you’re so chivalrous; but it’s no use. After all, as
I said before, David has been a good husband to me,
according to his lights. This may, of course, break him
up rather, but it can’t be helped; he must be told. I
wonder—oh, I wonder how he’ll take it. They say
suffering’s good for writers, it strengthens their psychology.
Oh, my poor, poor David!—Never mind.
You’d better go out into the garden and wait——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>flustered</i>): Wait? What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: For me, Richard, for me. I will come to you
later. Wait in the summer-house. I had begun to think
that Romance was dead, that I should never know it
again. Before, of course, I had my work and my life in
the theatre, but now, nothing—nothing! Everything is
empty and hollow, like a broken shell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Look here, Judith, I apologise for what I
did just now. I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>ignoring all interruption</i>): But now you have
come, and it’s all changed—it’s magic. I’m under a spell
that I never thought to recapture again. Go along——(<i>She
pushes him towards the garden.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span> (<i>protesting</i>): But, Judith——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>pushing him firmly</i>): Don’t—don’t make it
any harder for me. I am quite resolved—it is my self-appointed
Calvary, and it’s the only possible way!</p>

must all be very quiet, and think——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: It was nothing, really. For Heaven’s sake——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Nothing! I open the library door casually,
and what do I see? I ask you, what do I see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I’m most awfully sorry....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Ssshh! It has gone beyond superficial apologies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Mother, be natural for a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I don’t know what you mean, Sorel. I’m trying
to realise a very bitter truth as calmly as I can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: There’s nothing so very bitter about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: My poor child!</p>

he loves me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: That would be the only possible excuse for
your behaviour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Why shouldn’t we love each other if we
want to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Sandy was in love with me this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Not real love—you know it wasn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>bitterly</i>): I know now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>splendidly</i>): Youth will be served. You’re so
pretty, Sorel, far prettier than I ever was—I’m very glad
you’re pretty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I feel a fearful cad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Why should you? You’ve answered the only
call that really counts—the call of Love, and Romance,
and Spring. I forgive you, Sandy, completely. There.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Well, that’s all right, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I resent your tone, Sorel; you seem to be
taking things too much for granted. Perhaps you don’t
realise that I am making a great sacrifice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Sorry, darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It’s far from easy, at my time of life, to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Understand! You forget, dear, I am a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: I know you are, Mother. That’s what makes
it all so poignant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>magnanimously, to <span class="smcap">Sandy</span></i>): If you want Sorel,
truly, I give her to you—unconditionally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> (<i>dazed</i>): Thanks—awfully, Mrs. Bliss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You can still call me Judith, can’t you?—it’s
not much to ask.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Judith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>bravely</i>): There, now. Away with melancholy.
This is all tremendously exciting, and we must all
be very happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Don’t tell Father—yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: We won’t tell anybody; it shall be our little
secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: You are splendid, Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Nonsense. I just believe in being honest with
myself—it’s awfully good for one, you know, so cleansing.

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span> (<i>nonchalantly</i>): I was only playing up—one
always plays up to Mother in this house; it’s a sort of
unwritten law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Didn’t she mean all she said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: No, not really; we none of us ever mean anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: She seemed awfully upset.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: It must have been a slight shock for her to
discover us clasped tightly in each other’s arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I believe I do love you, Sorel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: A month ago I should have let you go on believing
that, but now I can’t—I’m bent on improving
myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Never mind—it doesn’t matter. You just fell
a victim to the atmosphere, that’s all. There we were
alone in the library, with the windows wide open, and
probably a nightingale somewhere about——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I only heard a cuckoo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Even a cuckoo has charm, in moderation.
You kissed me because you were awfully nice and I was
awfully nice and we both liked kissing very much. It was
inevitable. Then Mother found us and got dramatic—her
sense of the theatre is always fatal. She knows we
shan’t marry, the same as you and I do. You’re under
absolutely no obligation to me at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I wish I understood you a bit better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: Yes. Do you know why I came down here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: We’d better talk it all over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span> (<i>making a movement</i>): I shall do nothing of the
sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Please—please don’t be difficult.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: I apologise, Judith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Don’t apologise—I quite understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: Please let go of my hand, David; I should like
to go to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I should stay if I were you—it would be more
dignified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: There isn’t any real necessity for a scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I don’t want a scene. I just want to straighten
things out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Very well—go ahead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: June has always been an unlucky month
for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: Look here, Judith, I’d like to explain one
thing——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>austerely</i>): I don’t wish to hear any explanations
or excuses—they’re so cheapening. This was bound
to happen sooner or later—it always does, to everybody.
The only thing is to keep calm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: I am—perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>sharply</i>): There is such a thing as being too
calm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Sorry, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Life has dealt me another blow, but I don’t
mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: What did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>crossly</i>): I said Life had dealt me another
blow, but I didn’t mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Rubbish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>gently</i>): You’re probably irritable, dear,
because you’re in the wrong. It’s quite usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Now, Judith——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Ssshhh! Let me speak—it is my right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: I don’t see why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>surprised</i>): I am the injured party, am I not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: Injured?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>firmly</i>): Yes, extremely injured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>): Injured!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Your attitude, David, is nothing short of
deplorable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: It’s all nonsense—sheer, unbridled nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: No, David, you can’t evade the real issues as
calmly as that. I’ve known for a long time—I’ve realised
subconsciously for years that you’ve stopped caring for me
in “that way.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span> (<i>irritably</i>): What do you mean—“that way”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>with a wave of the hand</i>): Just that way....
It’s rather tragic, but quite inevitable. I’m growing old
now—men don’t grow old like women, as you’ll find to
your cost, Myra, in a year or two. David has retained his
youth astonishingly, perhaps because he has had fewer
responsibilities and cares than I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: This is all ridiculous hysteria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span> (<i>looking at her and not liking her very much</i>): No,
Myra—Judith is right. What are we to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span> (<i>furious</i>): Do? Nothing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>ignoring her</i>): Do you love her truly, David?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Madly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span> (<i>astounded</i>): David!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span> (<i>intensely</i>): You thought just now that I was
joking. Couldn’t you see that all my flippancy was only a
mask, hiding my real emotions—crushing them down
desperately——?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span> (<i>scared</i>): But, David, I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I knew it! The time has come for the dividing
of the ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: What on earth do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I mean that I am not the sort of woman to
hold a man against his will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: You’re both making a mountain out of a mole-hill.
David doesn’t love me madly, and I don’t love him.
It’s——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Ssshhh!—you <i>do</i> love him. I can see it in
your eyes—in your every gesture. David, I give you to
her—freely and without rancour. We must all be good
friends, always.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Judith, do you mean this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>with a melting look</i>): You know I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: How can we ever repay you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Just by being happy. I may leave this house
later on—I have a feeling that its associations may become
painful, specially in the autumn——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: Look here, Judith——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>shouting her down</i>): October is such a mournful
month in England. I think I shall probably go abroad—perhaps
a <i>pension</i> somewhere in Italy, with cypresses in
the garden. I’ve always loved cypresses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: What about the children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: We must share them, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: I’ll pay you exactly half the royalties I receive
from everything, Judith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>bowing her head</i>): That’s very generous of you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: You have behaved magnificently. This is a
crisis in our lives, and thanks to you——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span> (<i>almost shrieking</i>): Judith—I <i>will</i> speak—I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Ssshhh, Myra darling—we owe it to Judith
to keep control of our emotions—a scene would be agonising
for her now. She has been brave and absolutely splendid
throughout. Let’s not make things harder for her than we
can help. Come, we’ll go out into the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span>: I will <i>not</i> go out into the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span> (<i>twisting her handkerchief</i>): Please go—I don’t
think I can bear any more just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: So this is the end, Judith?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Yes, my dear,—the end.</p>

<p><i>It is Sunday morning, about ten o’clock. There are various
breakfast dishes on a side table, and a big table is laid
down centre.</i></p>

<div class="direction">

<p>[<i><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> appears at the top of the stairs. On seeing
no one about, he comes down quickly and furtively helps
himself to eggs and bacon and coffee, and seats himself
at the table. He eats very hurriedly, casting occasional
glances over his shoulder. A door bangs somewhere
upstairs, which terrifies him; he chokes violently. When
he has recovered, he tears a bit of toast from a rack,
butters it and marmalades it, and crams it into his
mouth. Then, hearing somebody approaching, he darts
into the library.</i></p>

<p>[<i><span class="smcap">Jackie</span> comes downstairs timorously; her expression
is dismal, to say the least of it. She looks miserably
out of the window at the pouring rain, then, assuming
an air of spurious bravado, she helps herself to some
breakfast and sits down and looks at it. After one or
two attempts to eat it, she bursts into tears.</i></p>

<p>[<i><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> opens the library door a crack, and peeps
out. <span class="smcap">Jackie</span>, seeing the door move, screams. <span class="smcap">Sandy</span>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Oh, it’s only you—you frightened me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I say, don’t cry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I’m not crying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: You were—I heard you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I don’t wonder—after last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: What were you doing in the library just now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Hiding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Hiding?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Yes; I didn’t want to run up against any of
the family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I wish I’d never come. I had horrible nightmares
with all those fearful dragons crawling across the
wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Dragons?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Yes; I’m in a Japanese room—everything in
it’s Japanese, even the bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: How awful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I believe they’re all mad, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Do you suppose they know they’re mad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: No; people never do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: It was Mr. Bliss asked me down, and he hasn’t
paid any attention to me at all. I went into his study soon
after I arrived yesterday, and he said, “Who the hell
are you?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Didn’t he remember?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: He did afterwards; then he brought me down
to tea and left me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Not properly. We talked it over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I don’t know what happened to me. I was in
the garden with Simon, and he was being awfully sweet,
and then he suddenly kissed me, and rushed into the house
and said we were engaged—and that hateful Judith asked
me to make him happy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: That’s exactly what happened to me and Sorel.
Judith gave us to one another before we knew where we
were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: How frightful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: I like Sorel, though; she was jolly decent about
it afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: I think she’s a cat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: Look at the way she lost her temper over that
beastly game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackie</span>: That wouldn’t be very difficult.</p>

swept out of the Rue St. Honoré into the Place de la
Concorde——”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: That sounds absolutely ridiculous. Why don’t
you alter it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: It isn’t ridiculous; it’s perfectly right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Very well, then; get a map, and I’ll show you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: We haven’t got a map.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span> (<i>putting his MS. down</i>): Now, look here,
Judith—here’s the Rue Royale—(<i>He arranges the butter-dish
and marmalade-pot.</i>)—here’s the Crillon Hotel, and
<i>here’s</i> the Rue St. Honoré——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: It isn’t—it’s the Boissy d’Anglas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: That runs parallel with the Rue de Rivoli.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: You’ve got it all muddled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span> (<i>loudly</i>): I have <i>not</i> got it all muddled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Shut up yourself, you pompous little beast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I give you my solemn promise, David, that
you’re wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: I don’t want your solemn promise, because I

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: It’s no use arguing with Father, Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Why isn’t it any use arguing with Father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Because you’re both so pig-headed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Are you content to sit here, Judith, and let
your son insult me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: He’s your son as well as mine.</p>

anything again as long as I live. You’re not a bit interested
in my work, and you don’t give a damn whether I’m a
success or a failure.</p>

spoilt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: Spoilt! I like that! Nobody here spoils me—you’re
the most insufferable family to live with——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Well, why in Heaven’s name don’t you go
and live somewhere else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: There’s gratitude!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Gratitude for what, I’d like to know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sorel</span>: Mother, keep calm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: Calm! I’m furious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: What have you got to be furious about?
Everyone rushing round adoring you and saying how
wonderful you are——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judith</span>: I am wonderful, Heaven knows, to have
stood you for all these years.</p>

not to read far to perceive that ‘The Colonnade’ is a remarkable play. It
