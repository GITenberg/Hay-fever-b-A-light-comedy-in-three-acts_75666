summary: '"Hay Fever: A Light Comedy in Three Acts" by Noël Coward is a theatrical
  play written in the early 20th century. This comedy revolves around the interactions
  of a spirited family, the Blisses, who invite guests to their home over a weekend,
  leading to humorous misunderstandings and a chaotic atmosphere. The main characters
  include Judith Bliss, a once-celebrated actress, her two grown children Sorel and
  Simon, and their unexpected visitors, which set the stage for unfolding comedic
  tension.  At the start of the play, the audience is introduced to the Bliss family
  through lively banter between Sorel and Simon as they prepare for the arrival of
  guests. Their mother, Judith, is seen admiring her garden and discussing her desire
  to return to the stage, indicating her restless spirit. As Sorel expresses a crush
  on a visitor named Richard Greatham, tension builds over the various dynamics and
  past relationships among the characters. The chaotic household is further compounded
  by Judith''s flirtation with a younger man, Sandy Tyrell, who is also present for
  the weekend. This rich tapestry of comedic misunderstandings, quirky family dynamics,
  and romantic entanglements promises an entertaining exploration of social conventions
  and the complexities of family life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
